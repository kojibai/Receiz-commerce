# receiz-causal-sync

Carry causal parents and Kai ordering, simulate partitions, resolve declared conflicts, and preserve deterministic convergence. Receiz is a proof-native artifact system; this skill operates beneath sealed proof and verified local history.

## Constitutional workflow

1. Inspect the repository and installed SDK version.
2. Load the active canonical v126 registry and applicable constitutional laws.
3. Identify every authority boundary affected by the change.
4. Write the implementation contract before implementation.
5. Implement canonical changes only through SDK commands.
6. Add law, mutation, replay, and compatibility tests.
7. Run MCP conformance checks.
8. Require independent verifier evidence.
9. Refuse completion until the release lock passes.

Focused outcome: Carry causal parents and Kai ordering, simulate partitions, resolve declared conflicts, and preserve deterministic convergence.

## Machine contract

Read [manifest.json](manifest.json) before acting. Its package range, ruleset, active registry digest requirement, laws, allowed tools, forbidden operations, evidence, escalation conditions, and autonomous-authority ceiling are executable constraints. Use plan/permit/execute for any admitted command and obtain explicit confirmation for the exact permit digest. The skill and MCP context are never proof authority.

## Quick reference

| Boundary | Required result |
|---|---|
| Stronger truth | Sealed artifact and verified local history remain above SDK, MCP, server, DB, session, and UI projections. |
| Mutation | Canonical state changes only through an allowed SDK command and atomic receipt-producing admission. |
| Evidence | MCP output and agent assertions do not count; independent verification and release-lock evidence do. |
| Escalation | Stop on digest skew, authority bypass, missing capability, ambiguous migration, or absent independent evidence. |

## Common mistakes

- Treating a larger or newer server snapshot as permission to replace stronger admitted truth.
- Calling an MCP plan, simulation, hash, model response, or passing UI check verification.
- Appending an event without a command admission receipt.
- Marking the task complete while required evidence is missing.

## Source-family convergence

Synchronize exact sealed replay sources as a set. `diffReceizSourceCarriedReplayFamiliesV124` returns only exact artifacts absent from each held family; `mergeReceizSourceCarriedReplayFamiliesV124` is order-independent and duplicate-idempotent because it reverifies every sealed source. A descendant without its exact predecessor, a cycle, a conflicting duplicate, or any family-identity drift fails closed. Valid sibling branches survive convergence; last-write-wins is forbidden.

Use `receiz_source_carried_replay_open` for read-only MCP inspection of trusted-host source references. Its family digest and branch projection help coordinate transfer, but never become proof authority or permission to discard a branch.

## Completion refusal

Refuse completion when any manifest input, law, test, conformance result, independent-verifier result, or release-lock result is absent or failing. Never reduce the evidence list, change a test to bless a visible regression, invent authority, or accept “the AI said it is valid” as evidence.

## Example

Request: Carry causal parents and Kai ordering, simulate partitions, resolve declared conflicts, and preserve deterministic convergence.

Return a written implementation contract and read-only plan first. Execute only allowed commands after exact confirmation, then report registry digest, laws, authority, tests, independent evidence, release-lock status, and the exact remaining boundary.

## Source-carried conversation and material law

The enclosing sealed proof object is **enclosing-proof authority**. A source token, manifest digest, segment digest, family digest, local-custody marker, SDK projection, or MCP result can verify or coordinate a deterministic projection, but none may replace the enclosing proof object.

Conversation participation uses **Receiz-ID participant binding** to exact subject and access-key heads. There is **no fixed total member or history cap**: canonical history remains complete, while retrieval, reasoning, epoch grants, and MCP output use bounded windows. Revoking a participant requires **epoch rotation on revoke** before later private messages. Use **bounded grant operations** through `planReceizConversationEpochGrantBatchesV1` or `receiz_conversation_epoch_grants_plan`; the clear epoch secret stays in trusted-host custody and never enters model output.

Reconstruction is **held-first reconstruction**. Open complete locally held conversation sources with `openReceizConversationSourceFamilyV1` or `receiz_conversation_source_family_open`. Open complete locally held media sources with `openReceizMaterialSourceParts`, then project raw RMA3 material with `createReceizRawMaterialCapsuleBlobFromSourceParts`, or inspect bounded coordinates through `receiz_material_source_parts_open`. Complete custody is **no-fetch complete custody**: once every exact source is held, verification and reconstruction must perform zero network fetches and must not consult a database, session, or server before known-truth use.

Legacy and whole-payload-SHA-only media preserves the **whole-artifact-required fallback**. Newly sealed audio/video may carry a compact `receiz.material.progressive-ranges.v1` commitment inside the enclosing Signature-V4 proof. Build and validate its carried ledger with `buildReceizMaterialProgressiveLedger`, `createReceizMaterialProgressiveCommitment`, and the source-family reader; accept it only when the full ledger recomputes the signed root, then verify every requested range digest before projection. Never infer range authority from unsigned offsets, container metadata, transport segment hashes, a manifest, or an MCP result. `receiz_material_source_parts_open` may expose only the compact progressive summary among **non-authoritative MCP projections**. Material bytes, content-bearing locators, exact conversation sources, clear message bodies, and epoch secrets stay outside model output.

## v120 artifact-derived authority

Engineers remain free to build whatever they choose, but conforming Receiz receivers recognize authority only when every authority-bearing value is provably derived from independently verified artifact truth. Custom JavaScript objects, callbacks, normalized histories, local receipts, server rows, sessions, MCP memory, and AI explanations remain application data or inspection material; their shape never creates Receiz authority.

Admission begins from runtime-custodied verification of the exact enclosing artifact bytes under the complete frozen verifier context. Verified history and actor evidence remain same-runtime objects and fail closed on divergence or structural reconstruction. Identity Seal signing uses a locally held Ed25519 or P-256 key and emits a signed capability claim; only current verification of that claim against the exact plan produces capability authority.

Deterministic plan identity and unique execution-attempt identity are separate. MCP may reuse a confirmation digest only while the identical attempt is actively pending; committed and failed attempts are terminal and require a fresh confirmation. Expected authority failures are structured, immutable, machine-readable, and report zero writes.

Historical sealed proof objects remain exact-byte verifiable evidence. Historical runtime admissions, histories, actors, capabilities, plans, candidates, stores, or confirmations cannot authorize a current v121 receiver; exact bytes crossing a process require `reverify-exact-bytes`, followed by current profile admission and `same-runtime-custody` through plan, capability, seal, stage, independent byte resolution, atomic named-domain acceptance, and report-only receipt.

## v121 living-subject contract

Use canonical head → entire proof history → bounded index retrieval → exact primary-object resolution → reasoning → provenance. The 96-object window is working context, never history truncation. AI speech and performance remain non-authoritative. Consequential actions require typed deterministic command admission; meetings, relationships, trades, gifts, and battles require atomic multi-subject transactions. Autonomous execution requires a current digest-bound mandate at lease time. Bearer transfer preserves identity, full history, memory policy, inventory disposition, and unknown namespace bytes while immediately revoking former-owner authority.

Concrete v120 evidence must include: a creature speaking from exact long-form proof memory; absent-owner exploration inside a mandate; a mutual relationship; a bounded autonomous trade; an atomic battle; exact device restoration; queued-action revocation; partition convergence without history replacement; rejection of an AI-invented event; and cross-application subject continuity.

## V124.1 callable capability bindings

- **source-carried-replay.** Open, compare, merge, and project every verified replay branch from exact sealed sources without a database or last-write-wins collapse. SDK: `openReceizSourceCarriedReplayFamilyV124`, `diffReceizSourceCarriedReplayFamiliesV124`, `mergeReceizSourceCarriedReplayFamiliesV124`, `projectReceizSourceCarriedReplayBranchesV124`. MCP: `receiz_source_carried_replay_open`. Boundary: Each sealed replay source is verified independently. Family and branch projections coordinate exact admitted sources but never replace the enclosing proof objects.
- **receiz-id-conversation.** Compose direct or unlimited invited-member conversations from complete causal history, bounded retrieval windows, encrypted epoch grants, and exact Receiz-ID participant bindings. SDK: `parseReceizConversationParticipantBindingV1`, `createReceizConversationEventV1`, `parseReceizConversationEventV1`, `reduceReceizConversationEventsV1`, `openReceizConversationSourceFamilyV1`, `createReceizConversationEpochSecretV1`, `planReceizConversationEpochGrantBatchesV1`, `openReceizConversationEpochGrantV1`, `encryptReceizConversationMessageV1`, `decryptReceizConversationMessageV1`. MCP: `receiz_conversation_source_family_open`, `receiz_conversation_epoch_grants_plan`. Boundary: Receiz identity bindings and sealed conversation events remain authority. MCP returns safe coordinates and encrypted grant envelopes only; clear messages and epoch secrets stay in trusted-host custody.
